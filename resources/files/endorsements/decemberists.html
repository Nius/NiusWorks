			<h2>The Decemberists</h2>
			<h3>Indie Folk, Indie Pop, Baroque Pop</h3>
			<i>Having first been exposed to the Decemberists through their 2006 album, </i>The Crane Wife<i>, I have gradually come to hold them as my favorite group. Nearly every time I sit down to my piano I find myself playing and singing at least one of their songs, especially </I>After the Bombs<i> or </i>June Hymn<i>.
