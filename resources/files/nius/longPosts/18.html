One of the many functions of the average front desk agent (FDA) is to decide which room to assign to their guests. This post will explain some of the main considerations that go into the decision-making process and the science behind who does it and how.
<br><br>
<h4>When do rooms get assigned?</h4>
<br>
Like most things it varies from hotel to hotel. Some hotels will assign your room in the morning on the day of your arrival, and some will assign it the day before. Some might wait until you arrive, and some hotels might use a mixture of these policies depending on the reservation.
<br><br>
Generally hotels don't like to assign specific rooms more than a day or two in advance, because a lot can happen in the time between when you book and when you arrive.
<br>
Suppose you book in February for a July reservation. I take your reservation and tell you you're in room 214.
<br>
What if two days before your stay someone stays in room 214 and smokes weed all night and trashes the bathroom? It will take three days to bring that room up to spec and now I have to tell you that you don't get the room you were expecting.
<br>
Imagine that the weekend before your arrival we're nearly sold out and 214 is my last remaining single king. If I take a single-king reservation that starts that night and lasts for two weeks I have no choice but to put them in room 214. Now your room is occupied when you get here and I have to put you somewhere else. Don't worry, I definitely have a single king for you, but not room 214.
<br>
Hotels need to keep their options open or else it becomes very difficult to keep a clear picture of what is available for guests on any given day.
<br><br>
<h4>How can you guarantee my room if you don't even know what number it will be?</h4>
<br>
Consider the Maker Suites Hotel in the capital city on Kaitain. The Maker Suites has 204 rooms, of which 98 are single kings and 106 are two queens.
<br><br>
When you book a single king at the Maker Suites, their computer knows that it now only has 97 king rooms left to sell regardless of what room you might get put into. If the hotel books five other people then it knows there are only 92 kings left.
<br>
Supposing someone has some kind of catastrophic accident in room 107 a week before your arrival and it will take two weeks to repair the room. When the hotel tells the computer that 107 is out of order for two weeks the computer will reduce the number of available kings by one and, when assigning rooms to guests, pretend that room 107 does not exist.
<br>
The computer (and therefore your FDA's) know exactly how many rooms of each type are available on any given day, taking into account out-of-order rooms and multi-night stays. If 96 king rooms are booked and two are on maintenance the computer will tell me there are no single kings left and will not let me book another. When the day of arrival comes around, even though rooms 107 and 238 are out of order I still have exactly enough king rooms available to fit all the king reservations.
<br><br>
<h4>What if I have a special condition that limits what rooms I can use?</h4>
<br>
This varies from case to case, but there are some generalizations that can be made.
<br>
If you require an ordinary <a href='https://www.ada.gov/2010_regs.htm'>ADA</a> room, at many hotels those have their own classifications separate from single king, two-queen, and others. This way the computer knows how many ADA rooms are available and will not book more than the hotel has, just like any other room.
<br>
If you require something more specific, like a room near the elevator or far away from the ice machine, usually there are mechanisms in place to make those requests readily apparent to whomever is assigning rooms for the day. Your requests will be considered and the FDA will do their best to honor them.
<br>
Requests for things like "a good view" or "not near the ice machine" and other niceties are generally low-priority compared to requests from guests with medical problems or ADA requirements, but we still do our best to honor them.
<br>
In extreme cases the FDA who books your room, or the first FDA to see your reservation after it is made online, might assign your room in advance anyway. For example, my hotel has only one room that has a roll-in shower. If I see a reservation that I even suspect will need it I will assign it to that room right away so that nobody else can book it. Another example is when I have a guest who has a severe mobility issue and can't travel very far, I might pre-assign them a ground-floor room near the lobby. Importantly it is still possible that an FDA might have to un-assign such a room between booking and check-in, but they will do everything in their power to avoid it.
<br>
Pre-assigning rooms can make things tricky for assigning other guests, depending on the situation, so we try not to do this.
<br><br>
<h4>Why did you give me this room?</h4>
<br>
In the majority of cases it's left up to the front desk agent mostly arbitrarily to decide what room you get. If I'm pre-assigning rooms in the morning I consider your membership status, your length of stay, and the source of your reservation. Moonrock-tier members who book through our hotel's website get the most convenient rooms (best view, not a long walk from the elevator, near the ice machine, etc) while guests who book through an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_website#Online_travel_agencies'>OTA</a> or who are staying for two weeks might get a less-convenient room. It's important to note that regardless of where your room is located in the hotel all of the rooms of a certain type are essentially identical, so if you book a single king you'll get a single king even if it's a quarter-mile from the front desk.
<br>
If you're a walk-in or we simply didn't assign you a room before checkin then I have a bit more information to go on:
<br><br>
<blockquote>How friendly are you? Did you ask me nicely for an upgrade to the water view or did you flatly demand it? Do you have your 80-year-old mother in a wheelchair next to you? Do you have kids in tow? Are you obviously a tired business traveler who needs a place to crash before the 7:00 AM meeting tomorrow? Do you clearly have trouble hearing or seeing or walking? Do you have a huge van with you that requires special parking accommodations? Are you here for vacation or are you a truck driver passing through? Are you the sort of customer that will care about the view? Are you a smoker (even if not smoking in the room)? Are you here for the fishing trip or the wedding? Will you be drinking a lot with your buddies?</blockquote>
All of these factors, and similar things I can tell from a brief two-minute in-person interaction with you, will influence my decision on what room to assign you. I will do my best to pick a room that suits your needs and meets your desires while minimally limiting my options for rooms to give other guests.
<br>
For example, my hotel only has 8 ground-floor rooms and I will therefore not assign anyone a ground-floor room unless they ask for it, they clearly need it, or I have no other options.
<br>
Many guests come to my hotel for the view over the nearby marina, so our top-floor rooms on the water side of the building are in high demand. If you're a business traveler arriving at 22:20 you probably don't care about the view, so I'll assign you the second floor unless you ask for something specific. If you're a couple here for a weekend getaway arriving at 18:00 then I'll put you on the top floor in a room with a good view. If you have three little kids with you then I will do everything in my power to keep you away from my business travelers and construction workers who are here long-term and have crazy hours. If you're an obvious smoker I'll put you in that one corner of the hotel where all the smoke blows away from the building rather than down the walkway to the other rooms.
<br>
The point is that I know my hotel very well, and if I'm paying attention I can fairly easily pick out characteristics about you that give me a hint as to which of my rooms would be the best assignment for you. Of course if you have something specific in mind you should absolutely say something at check-in before I commit you to a room.
<br><br>
<h4>What happens when I ask for a specific room at checkin?</h4>
<br>
If you hit us with a surprise request we'll do our best to accommodate you. Chances are you are not the first person to ask us for whatever it is you're wanting, and you're probably not even the first <i>that day</i>. For example at my hotel I know that about 40% of my checkins are going to ask for a water-side upgrade.
<br>
It's not always possible. Even if you're an unobtanium-tier rewards member with ten million points we might not physically have a room for you in the southwest corner where you're asking to be. It might be because there are already guests there, or it might be that we're having work done on those rooms. It might be that your reservation is for two weeks and <i>next</i> Saturday we're sold out of the upgrade type you want, which is why we said the room is unavailable even though it's clearly empty tonight.
<br>
That said it is always better to mention your request as early as possible so that we can figure it into our plans the first time we try to solve the day's rooming puzzle.
<br><br>
<h4>What if I need to change rooms?</h4>
<br>
This is a fairly normal thing for hotels too, though we will do everything in our power to avoid having to do this. When you change rooms then you're effectively occupying two rooms simultaneously, until housekeeping gets around to cleaning your old room (remember we can't sell your old room until it's cleaned). Some hotels charge a fee for changing rooms after checking in, and others don't.
<br>
Of course there are legitimate reasons to need to change rooms, like a sudden change in medical needs or a building malfunction or some other unforeseen event. Today I had to ask a guest to change rooms because the schedule on our ongoing construction project changed and his room was suddenly unavailable for part of his stay. In these cases you can be certain that asking you to move was a last resort and the hotel is just as unhappy to ask you to move as you are to pack up and relocate.
<br>
In all cases changing rooms requires patience from the hotel and the guest alike, and it's important to remember that you might have already gotten the last room of your type - or the last room in the whole hotel.
<br><br>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<br>
The hotel is an enormous, constantly shifting rubik's cube. Every day different rooms are occupied, cleaned, on maintenance block, or just not cleaned yet. Every day we have different guests with different demands, each with specific room types and stay dates. We take all of this into account when assigning rooms, even if it only appears to take the FDA ten seconds to make a decision, and we really are doing our best to make your stay efficient and enjoyable.
