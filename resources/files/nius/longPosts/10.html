This is a bit of improvisation for my first experiment with recording with my current hardware resources.<br>
The video was recorded on a tablet while the audio was recorded to a computer in the next room. The audio and video were edited together after the fact, which was a pain because the two devices sampled at different rates. I did my best to make the picture and sound match correctly.<br>
The audio quality suffers where the input gain was too high; in future recordings this issue will be addressed.
