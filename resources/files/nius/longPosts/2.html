About a year ago I underwent a phase in which I was enamored with the holiday carol <span class='italic'>Away in a Manger</span>. I found myself whistling it at work and singing it when I was alone, and at least daily playing it on my piano. There are two different musical settings for the carol; for these purposes I speak of what I believe to be the more common one, "Mueller".<br>

On one winter afternoon amid this preoccupation I was enjoying the liberty of being alone by improvising lyrics to the tune. I was  experimenting with the role-reversed idea that the "little lord Jesus" is now the omnipotent Son of God who watches us in our own spiritual infancies. "<span class='italic'>Be here at my cradle lord Jesus I pray</span>" I sang at one point, alluding to our vulnerability as sinners despite  our adulthood and our strength as humans.<br>
This passage reminded me of a prayer my father used to say. Growing up my family routinely shared evening meals together, and we held the custom of praying beforehand. This was my father's standard, from which he rarely deviates even today:
<blockquote class='no-repel'>Be present at our table, Lord.<br>
Be here and everywhere adored.<br>
These creatures bless and grant that we<br>
may feast in paradise with thee.</blockquote>
Simple and succinct, this prayer is a direct quote of an old christian hymn:
<blockquote>Be present at our table, Lord;<br>
be here and everywhere adored;<br>
thy creatures bless, and grant that we<br>
may feast in paradise with thee.<br>

It occured to me that this prayer can be set to "Mueller" and adapted slightly to fit in with the rest of the carol, and is remarkably similar to the original final verse:
<blockquote class='no-repel'><style>
tr:not(first-child) > td:first-child
{
	padding-right:	5px;
}
tr:not(first-child) > td:nth-child(2)
{
	padding-left:	5px;
}
tr:nth-child(2n)
{
	color:		#BBBB8B;
}
</style>
<table><tbody><tr class='bold italic lightBlue'><td>Adaptation</td><td class='pad-left'>Original Final Verse</td></tr>
<tr>
	<td>Be here at our table my dear baby Lord.</td>
	<td>Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>Be here and everywhere always adored.</td>
	<td>Close by me forever, and love me, I pray.</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>These creatures bless and grant that we</td>
	<td>Bless all the dear children in thy tender care,</td>
</tr><tr>
	<td>may feast in paradise always with thee.</td>
	<td>And take us to heaven, to live with Thee there.</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>
Each but the second pair of lines paraphrases each other, and in both passages the second line points to love in perpetuity.<br>
Though there are many Methodist hymns and tunes which avail themselves to being re-set with ease, this discovery remains a pleasant surprise.<br>
<br>
Perahps each of these can be added respectively to the general repertoire of highly versatile poems and tunes. For the moment, I shall continue indulging when I'm certain nobody is nearby.
